  Inspects a portion of the Hub tree provided by the cell through its JSON/HTTP
  API. This does not provide as much detail as Hub.dump/0 in the Hub modules,
  as only "public" key/value pairs are shown.

  ## Options

  The `path` parameter may be passed to specify a subtree to aquire

  ## Examples

    iex> run(".189")
    # would aquire the whole Hub tree

    iex> run(".189", "services")
    # would aquire the subtree starting a /services
